CSCI-347 Learning Reflection

Name: Preston Duffield

================================================================
1. What are some of the most important lessons you learned while working on this assignment? Why do you think so?

One of the most important lessons I learned while working on this assignment was how to create a multithreaded program using POSIX threads.
Another lesson was how to manipulate images in C, from managing files as input to actually changing the file itself.
Reading and writing P6 images in edge_detector was something I had never done before, and was very interesting.

==========================================================================
2. What do you want to learn more about, and why?

I would like to learn about the possiblility of using other image formats. I had never heard of PPM before, and never seen a .ppm file.
This program would be more useful if it could manipulate jpeg or png files, as those are much more common formats.
I would also like a deeper understanding of the laplacian filter used. I feel as though I understand the filter enough to implement it,
but the internal mechanism is still a little unclear.

==========================================================================
3. What were some of your most challenging/powerful moments and what made them so?

Some of the most challenging moments where managing race conditions.
I had some issues with threads in the earlier stages of the project that seemed like some "computer magic" was happening.
Really it was just a matter of threads changing variables at the wrong time, but debgging this was difficult.
The most powerful moment was when I ran the program on a .ppm image and actually got the correct result.
This was exciting as it meant I was done with the difficult part and just had to implement the remainder of the reqiurements.

===============================================================================
4. What did you learn were your greatest strengths? Your biggest areas for improvement?

I learned that my debugging skills have improved. I was able to more quickly find the issue with my threads. I could still use improvement in this area, however.
I find that I get on a roll with programming and then one small bug takes me out of that flow state.
Then I have to chase a bug around before I can get back, once its solved, I have to get back into the context where I left off, which can be difficult.

5. Reread the learning objectives (LOs) of the assignment. State them below and rate your confidence about them on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is Not Confident at all, and 5 is Very Confident. 
Example: LO1: Demonstrate how to write clean and readable code in C. (Confidence level: 4)

LO1: Construct a multithreaded program using POSIX threads. (Confidence level: 5)

LO2: Demonstrate how to read and write binary files. (Confidence level: 5)

LO3: Employ efficient synchronization mechanisms. (Confidence level: 4)

LO4: Examine race conditions using Helgrind, and memory errors using Valgrind. (Confidence level: 3)

LO5: Apply C programming best practices. (Confidence level: 5)

LO6: Recognize the effect of the number of threads on the program's performance. (Confidence level: 5)
